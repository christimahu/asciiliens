            <p>ASCII + Aliens = ASCIIliens -- Turn-Based ASCII Arcade Action.</p>
            <p>This project is a nostalgic recreation of one of my very first programs, originally written in Borland C++ when I was 13 years old. Back then, it ran on an incredible machine: an x386sx, boasting a whopping 4MB of RAM (with an expansion board!), and displayed its glory on a CRT monitor that knew only green letters – no fancy graphics, just pure ASCII.</p>
            <p>This rewrite in Rust is a fun way to keep that original program alive, bringing its core logic and turn-based gameplay into a modern, safe, and performant language.</p>

                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Navigate:</strong> Use the <code>LEFT</code> and <code>RIGHT</code> arrow keys to move your ship (║_||_║).</li>
                    <li><strong>Fire:</strong> Press <code>SPACE</code> to fire **blasts** (*).</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategic Action:</strong> Each action (move or fire) advances one game frame. You cannot move and fire in the same 'turn'.</li>
                    <li><strong>Score:</strong> Start with 100 points, lose 1 point for each movement or **blast**, and gain 250 points for destroying an ASCIIlien.</li>
                    <li><strong>Win/Lose:</strong> Defeat all aliens to win, or lose if aliens reach the bottom of the screen or collide with your ship.</li>
                </ol>
